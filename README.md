# Text 2 SQL Chain using Langchain

Simple implementation using LCEL and LangChain. Queries through a transaction database with two tables "transaction" and "categories" 

**Note** This is part of a bigger personal side project, where I want to train a budget copilot for my transactions in the past 3 years and automate my budgeting and spend analysis.
